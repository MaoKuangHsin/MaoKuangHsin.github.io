      <h2>Studying and Living in Singapore</h2>
      <p>Studying in Singapore is an inspiring journey, surrounded by people from all over the world. Through daily interactions, I am meeting friends from different countries and learning about their cultures, values, and traditions. Singapore’s diverse environment continues to expand my worldview and strengthen my appreciation for global connections.

      <h2>Why I Love Data Science</h2>
      <p>I've always been curious about how things work and why people make certain choices. Data science lets me explore those questions, solve problems, and share what I find with others. I love that it’s not just about numbers — it’s about understanding people, ideas, and the stories behind the data.</p>
